WASHINGTON D.C.– President Richard Nixon announced his resignation amid impeachment proceedings stemming from the Watergate scandal and the administration’s attempt to resist a congressional investigation. The scandal exposed abuses of power by the White House after five burglars were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C. in 1972. Nixon became the only U.S. president to resign.
