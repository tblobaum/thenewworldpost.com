The First Emperor of China was a Babylonian who sought all-knowledge and immortality. 

## Calendars

The Chinese adopted the Babylonian calendar around 200 BC toward the end of the days of Babylon. The Jews had already adopted this calendar as their own. 

If you look into the Jewish calendar you may notice the days of the week are similar to Chinese words. 

"In the center of the thing simply dao de ding.""In the China of the thing simply do the thing." The Dao speaks of the center many times. It is said that in order to achieve immortality one must simply root one's self in the center. 

The first emperor of China simply did the thing in the center of the thing. He was connected to Babylon, he created the Terra Cotta Army and built pyramids, united China for the first time into a sane secular world superpower. 

This is probably what the ever more ancient founders of Israel desired. Jerusalem is after all the oldest city in the world because it is in the center of the world. The Terra Cotta Army is in a place called Zion in the heartland of China. 

Paintings of the first emperor depict a man who seems to be half Jewish, half Chinese. This man sought all-knowledge, immortality, and total global domination, along with his fellow Babylonians, and he did so in the center. He gave China the Babylonian calendar (or was it the other way around?? Some the jewish days of the week look Chinese). 

China was meant to become the Order of the Ages, like Babylon, Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, the Holy Roman Empire, the UK, the USA and the USSR, the sane central power which was planned by someone like a farmer and not like most nations of the world which grow like wild berries. Israel was reborn on the Chinese day 4/6/4646, the year of the rat.
