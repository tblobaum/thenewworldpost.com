CHINA– Nixon, a virulent anti-communist earlier in his political career, surprised the American public when he traveled to Beijing for a week of talks in a historic first step toward normalizing relations between the United States and the People’s Republic of China. Until this trip, the United States and communist China were de facto enemies, fighting proxy wars on the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s and South Vietnam at the time of Nixon’s visit.
