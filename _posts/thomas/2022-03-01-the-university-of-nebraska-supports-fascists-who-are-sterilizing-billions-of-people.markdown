Ever wonder why Nebraska is known by the majority of America as a "flyover state?" In this post you can read about the main reason why.

>“For those that believe, no explanation is necessary. For those that do not, no explanation will suffice.”

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/football-censored.jpg)  

Nebraska has a very serious social problem. At the flagship University of Nebraska in the state's capitol there is an entrenched two-faced Neo-Nazi Conspiracy with roots in the Civil Rights Era.

Yeah, you read that right. It's also very vast, widespread, and its right in everyone's face. 

The current adminstrators of the school will deny this is true. As I'm sure a man like Tom Osbourne will, too. But they are being untruthful when they deny it. Some of them are being deceitful intentionally. Some are just ignorant. Either way, they are spreading a falsehood. 

The truth is that the blackshirts at the university are a fascist group. The shortest route to conviction? The name. Just google the word blackshirts and fascist groups appear on the page along with the university's football team. Also, the flag serves as clear and convincing evidence that they are tied to the fascist blackshirts of history, while the fact that they were founded in the very politically turbulent year 1964 serves as evidence that the naming was politically motivated (most things were politically motivated in that time period). 

If the shared name and the year isnt enough just look at the flag and compare it to the flags of the fascist blackshirts of history. The school's flag is black and uses a skull and cross bones just like the fascists of history. The flag has the same basic qualities as the fascist groups. I go into the details below. 

Let me be clear: the Blackshirts at the Univeristy of Nebraska are the Blackshirts of history and their weapon is corn which is also their final solution for the class and race problem. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/defcon3.jpg)

If the school isn't going to throw out the Blackshirts then they should at least consider making an update to their uniforms to let people know to stay away from the "corn."

There is a fertility crisis brewing in the world. In a matter of only 10 to 20 years the majority of young healthy american couples will need fertility treatment to have a child. Jeremy Grantham believes only the rich will be able to procreate because they'll be the only ones who can afford the expensive fertility treatment. This fertility crisis will change everything and truly the future belongs to those souls who eat organic. The University of Nebraska is connected to this crisis. The Blackshirts at UNL are the Blackshirts of history and their weapon is corn. 

More specifically, the weapon of the Blackshirts is GMO Corn, and all GMO foods. These foods have trace amounts of the herbicide glyphosate on them. Some of the herbicide can be washed off, however, it is similar to a kool-aid stain on a carpet. Glyphosate is a cousin to Sarin Nerve Gas and VX nerve gas and even trace amounts of it damage the cells in the body which happens when they replicate. What ends up happening is the glyphosate targets the male reproductive organs more than anywhere else because that’s where the highest number of cellular divisions takes place. The Nebraska Blackshirts are exterminating the commoners of the West with chemical castration. Switching everyone to organic overnight isnt possible even if the President of the United States of America wants to sign an executive order. What will happen at some point is a big rush to organic food stores. And that's why Jeff Bezos bought Whole Foods for $14 billion in 2017.

The football team has the same color scheme as Nazi Germany. And here's more: Nebraska is one of the most ethnically German states in America. 

The school has a fake story they label as the "official history" that they share with the community that explains the "history" of the blackshirts. The "official history" is a load of bullsh*t. You can find the real story if you keep reading. 

A big problem is that the majority of Nebraskans act in concert with the conspirators either because of an instinct to defend the status quo or an instinct to defend the school. Also, some act in defense of the conspiracy in a conscious manner. Actors involve themselves in the conspiracy in private while they deny that the conspiracy exists in public.  They do this in order to further the conspiracy by guarding it from the litigation of civil rights activists. These individuals collectively define the status quo in Nebraska along with the help of clueless individuals who do not perceive the reality of the situation. 

The status quo in Nebraska protects the conspiracy, allowing it to carry on existing, which ultimately terrorizes innocent people, especially Jews. This website can be used as a tool to inform which can be used to change the status quo in Nebraska and bring this conspiracy to an end. 

The more you look into the football program with a magnifying glass the more you can see clear evidence of an evil conspiracy. This webpage provides material evidence for use by individuals interested in challenging the status quo in Nebraska and by those involved in political activism or litigation.

This webpage serves as proof that there is a conspiracy to commit genocide on Jewish people that is supported by the University of Nebraska and that the involvement of the school is material. 

This webpage provides many of the details on the conspiracy but ultimately there are going to be some things that are missed. The webpage will be updated as more evidence surfaces.

The flagship University of Nebraska is located in downtown Lincoln, Nebraska. Racially, Lincoln is more than 85% white. The football team at the University is called the Cornhuskers. The Cornhuskers defense is called the Blackshirts. The Nebraska Blackshirts share their name with the fascist and Hitler-aligned British and Italian Blackshirts as well as the Waffen SS [1]. Surprisingly, it is not a mere coincidence. 

I estimate that at least thousands, and perhaps tens of thousands of white supremacists around Nebraska, and as many as hundreds of thousands or several million white supremacists around the United States, consider the UNL Blackshirts flag a central rallying point for their cause.

For the purposes of this document a conspiracy is stated as follows:

>A conspiracy, also known as a plot, is a secret plan or agreement between persons (called conspirers or conspirators) for an unlawful or harmful purpose, such as murder or treason, especially with political motivation, while keeping their agreement secret from the public or from other people affected by it. In a political sense, conspiracy refers to a group of people united in the goal of usurping, altering or overthrowing an established political power. Depending on the circumstances, a conspiracy may also be a crime, or a civil wrong. The term generally implies wrongdoing or illegality on the part of the conspirators, as people would not need to conspire to engage in activities that were lawful and ethical, or to which no one would object. [2]

It is worth mentioning that it is unclear what reasoning ability, knowledge or background is required to fully understand the points being made in this document. One can argue that, given the content, the "confused" are often white supremacists, who are not telling the truth, but that is not the case with everyone. In any case there is a level of education requiredto understand it at all. 

The top article on Google when you search for "Nebraska Blackshirts" or "Blackshirts" is the following one which calls out the Blackshirts as likely to be the Blackshirts of history: 

<a href="https://thenewworldpost.com/nebraska/2022/01/01/its-probably-time-for-nebraska-to-retire-the-blackshirts-nickname.html" data-iframely-url></a>

## A.) Flags
More than a few flags link the UNL Blackshirts to fascism.

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/ne-blackshirts-flag.jpg)

### University of Nebraska Blackshirts
The Nebraska blackshirts flag was first adopted in the mid 1980s. The story is that it was inspired by a poison bottle. The guy who came up with it supposedly had a mouse problem and he thought of the blackshirts when he thought of the poison because he saw both as dangerous. The official story is a lie. This document purports that the flag is inspired by the Italian Blackshirts flag and probably one of the flags for the Waffen SS. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/italian-blackshirts.jpg)

### Italian Blackshirts
The Voluntary Militia for National Security, commonly called the Blackshirts, was originally the paramilitary wing of the National Fascist Party, and after 1923 an all-volunteer militia of the Kingdom of Italy under Fascist rule, similar to the SA in Nazi Germany. Its members were distinguished by their black uniforms and their loyalty to Benito Mussolini, the Duce (leader) of Fascism, to whom they swore an oath. Their methods became harsher as Mussolini's power grew, and they used violence and intimidation against Mussolini's opponents.

The Blackshirts were established in 1919 and consisted of many disgruntled former soldiers. It was given the task of leading fights against their bitter enemies – the Socialists.

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/nazi-waffen-ss.jpg)

### Waffen SS (Blackshirts)
The Waffen-SS was the military branch of the Nazi Party's SS organisation.

>Members of the Waffen-SS were involved in numerous atrocities. At the post-war Nuremberg trials, the Waffen-SS was judged to be a criminal organisation due to its connection to the Nazi Party and direct involvement in numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity. Members of the Waffen SS are known as Blackshirts.

### All Three Blackshirts Flags Shown Above
The Waffen SS, Italian Blackshirts and Nebraska Blackshirts flags all:

1. Have a black background
2. Have a white skull in the center
3. Are menacing in nature

The Nebraska Blackshirts flag is clearly inspired by the Waffen SS and Italian Blackshirts flags. The Nebraska flag carries the name blackshirts, while also having a design similar to the other blackshirts flags, giving the signal that they are of the same mind. 

The Waffen SS, Nebraska Blackshirts, and Italian Blackshirts flags are very similar and they all go by the name Blackshirts. This is not a coincidence. This is clear and convincing evidence of a conspiracy. Please don’t be fooled. There is a wealth of information in this document that connects the UNL Blackshirts to fascism, though this first connection we have made is the cornerstone. 

### The Flag of the Nazi Party & the Flag of UNL
The University of Nebraska flag shares a few qualities with the flag of Nazi Germany. They both:

<div class="w100">
    <div class="w50 left"> 
        <img src="/assets/images/conspiracy/nazi-flag.jpg" /> 
    </div>
    <div class="w50 right">
        <img src="/assets/images/conspiracy/ne-flag.jpg" /> 
    </div>
</div>

1. Have a red background
2. Have white in the center
3. Have something zig-zag in the center

The flag of Nazi Party and the flag of UNL sharing qualities is a coincidence, but still, it is important to note that the UNL Flag is used by hardcore fans as a standin for the flag of the Nazi Party. Additionally, the shared qualities probably have something to do with keeping the conspiracy going, as well as the start of it. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/german-flag-striped.jpg)

### 1933-1935 Nazi Party
This flag of the Nazi Party from the early 1930s shows UNL's color scheme off. If only that was the only connection UNL would easily be off the hook. But its not the only connection to Nazism. There is a vast number of connections that we can make. This is probably the most basic one. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/german-standard.jpg)

### Standard of Adolf Hitler
The standard of Adolf Hitler has a color scheme that is red, black and white with a touch of gold. This is the same color scheme as the Cornhuskers. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/german-flag.jpg)

### Germany
The colors of modern Germany are red, black and gold. These colors are essentially the same as the standard of Adolf Hitler and Cornhuskers, just without the color white. And yes, I do find it is suspicious that the modern German flag carries the same colors as the standard of Adolf Hitler. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/native-american-flag.jpg)

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/berlin-belgium.jpg)

### Native Americans
Native Americans, who have long carried the swastika, have flags similar to the German flag. The Native American flags have the full colors of the standard of Adolf Hitler, which are the same as the Cornhuskers: red, black, gold and white. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/ne-hawks.jpg)

### First Reich and Third Reich
Every year the Cornhuskers play the Iowa Hawkeyes around Thanksgiving in a game called the Heroes Game. The yellow and black Hawkeyes fans mixed together with the red, black, white and yellow Cornhuskers fans turn the stadium into the colors of Germany.

Additionally, the flag of the Iowa Hawkeyes is similar to the flag of the first Reich (just search for the flag of the Holy Roman Empire) and this is known by the hardcore fans. The Heroes game is thus the first Reich versus the third Reich. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/heroes-game.jpg)

One might say that "war hawks" are the ones responsible for the conspiracy that engulfs these two states. A war hawk, or simply hawk, is a term used in politics for someone who favors war or continuing to escalate an existing conflict as opposed to other solutions. War hawks are the opposite of doves. Nebraska clearly has the character of a passive aggressive war hawk. By going along with the conspiracy Iowa does too.

One might take a moment and wonder what affect the Corn-Nazis have had on the very important Iowa Caucuses. If there was a "great" time to assassinate a presidential candidate then you could probably say it is around the time of the Iowa Caucsues. Such an event would lead to fear, confusion, a lack of leadership, and because of how important winning the Iowa Caucus is an assassination there would almost certainly lead to the other political party winning the election. 

It is reasonable to conclude that there is more extremism in Iowa because of the University of Nebraska. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that because of the importance of the Iowa Caucus, that  there is a much greater chance that a Democrat front-runner is assassinated in Iowa because of this and also because of the University of Nebraska. There is probably also a slightly increased chance of a Republican front-runner being assassinated in Iowa. 

### Other Flags
There are other flags and merchandise by the Cornhuskers that have a political, Nazi or German affiliation. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/ne-anarchist.jpg)

###  Anarchist / Alt-Right Flag
This flag uses the Anarchist design. A poster in a thread on reddit responds to those behind the flag saying, “don't think we don't know what your up to, vast underground conspiracy known as the Alt-Right.” [6] The poster also mocks UNL, stating that the use of the skull and cross bones in the same instance as the use of the term Blackshirts implies that the use of the word blackshirts is not coincidental. This is the same conclusion that any non-biased group individual will reach after reading this web page. 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_symbolism" data-iframely-url></a>

Another flag features the word “national” as in “National Socialism.”

## B.) Corroborating Evidence
There is corroborating evidence that connects Nebraska to Right-Wing extremism, fascism, and Nazi Germany. 

### Point 1: Nebraska & Nazi Germany are both Right-Wing states
Nebraska, like Nazi Germany, is one of the most right-wing states on its continent/in its region. 

### Point 2: Nebraska & Nazi Germany are both ethnic German states
German was almost 100% German after Hitler had his way with the place. Nebraska is the most German-American state in the United States. It is the only state with the German-American ethnic group as the largest ethnic group in every county. It follows that since the Germans were the Nazis, then the most German-American state would have the highest (or a high) percentage of Neo-Nazis. It just so happens that not only does the most German-American state have a high percentage of Neo-Nazis, but it even has a state-funded Neo-Nazi college sports team. 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Nebraskan" data-iframely-url></a>

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/ne-center.jpg)

### Point 3: Nebraska & Nazi Germany are both Geo-Central states
Germany and Nebraska are both in the exact center of their respective continents. This is evidence that shows how Nebraska is similar to Germany. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/ne-blackshirts.jpg)

### Point 4: Nebraska & Nazi Germany have the same color scheme
The Blackshirts have the same red, white and black color scheme as the Nazis. It cannot go unsaid that this is because of the Blackshirts. Without the Blackshirts the red and white color scheme of UNL is innocent. The Blackshirts add black to the red and white (while simultaneously bringing in the skull and the Blackshirts name). The color scheme of Nebraska football is red, white, and black with a touch of gold. This is the same color scheme as Nazi Germany. 

### Point 5: Nebraska Blackshirts & the Nazi Party were both founded during politically turbulent times
The Nazis were founded in the turbulent 20s and 30s. Hitler seized control of the country and was deeply anti-Semitic. The Blackshirts of Nebraska were also founded during politically turbulent times. The Blackshirts were founded in Nebraska 1964 or 1963 depending on who you ask, and many fans know this, but what most don’t know is the rest of the story. The blackshirts were formed when America was on the verge of a Civil War. This was within a year of the Civil Rights Act being signed. The same era where President Kennedy was assassinated in Texas. These events coinciding with one another is not a coincidence. Rather than being done by the left as the Civil Rights Act was, the establishment of the Nebraska Blackshirts was done by the far right-wing. The “official” story as to why the Cornhuskers defense is called the Blackshirts is a lie. The truth is that the far-right promoted neo-nazism and fascism in Nebraska because of the qualities of the population and geography, and they put the Blackshirts here in response to what the left was doing in the country. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/ne-blackshirts-definition.jpg)

### Point 6: A Single Google Search Yields Results for Both
Simply google the word Blackshirts and take a look around. You’ll see fascists in Italy with a black flag with a white skull on it, and fascists in England (many doing the sieg heil) who share the page with images and information about the Cornhuskers defense. 

According to google’s dictionary, a Blackshirt is a member of the Italian Blackshirts or the Waffen SS. 

It is important to note that only a mere 20 years ago we did not have Google around to enable us to convict the blackshirts so readily. In the 1960s when the blackshirts were formed and in the 1970s and 1980s when the flag was created, only hardcore followers of politics, history or fascism could have understood the true meaning and the intentions of the men behind it. ​

For anyone who doesnt think the Waffen SS also goes by the name Blackshirts, Google will clear that up for you, too. 

### Point 7: The University Mascot uses a White Power Hand Sign
A hand sign adopted by members of 4chan, which then spread all around the world, can be traced back to the mascot of the Cornhuskers and the UNL Blackshirts conspirators.

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/ne-4chan.jpg)

### Point 8: The Swastika Carved in the Forehead
The "swastika carved on the center of the forehead" from WW2 can be seen on University of Nebraska Blackshirts imagery.

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/ne-forehead.jpg)

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/nazi-forehead.jpg)

### Point 9: Heil Big Red
There exists an ever-present aura of Neo-Nazism with regards to Football at UNL. Here is a quote from their website: 

"The spring game has been set for Saturday, April 18 at Memorial Stadium."

The Nebraska Football Spring Game just so happens to fall within 2 days of Adolf Hitler’s birthday, on April 18th of all days (Adolf Hitler was born on April 20th). 18 is a white supremacist alphanumeric code for Adolf Hitler (1=A and 8=H).

Is this a coincidence or is the football institution oozing Nazism? You can be the judge. Additional text from the website shows their numerology doesn’t stop there: 

"Nebraska fans may purchase tickets on-line at Huskers.com or by phone at 1-800-8-BIG RED."

88 means Heil Hitler (8=H) so 8 an be either Heil or Hitler. This phone number can then be decoded probably as “HEIL BIG RED.” 

### Point 10: The Blackshirts In Nebraska Make Sense  
![](/assets/images/conspiracy/blackshirts-cities.jpg) 

### Point 11: Hollywood Is Following Along  

#### Everyone knows Star Wars is connected to the Nazis 
JJ Abrams said the characters of Star Wars are inspired by Nazis.  

<a href="https://time.com/4010014/j-j-abrams-star-wars-force-awakens-villain-nazi/" data-iframely-url></a>  

He said The First Order is as if the Nazis regrouped in Argentina and how that would go.  What JJ Abrams meant to say is that its the Nazis regrouped in Nebraska.  Nebraska is Planet Naboo in Star Wars. 

#### Planet Naboo  

Nebraska is Planet Naboo the home of the main characters.

<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="height: 140px; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naboo" data-iframely-url="//iframely.net/YmJsPdR?card=small"></a></div></div>   

![](/assets/images/starwars/starwars.jpg)  

#### Planet Nibiru  

Nebraska is also the Doomsday Planet Nibiru in Star Trek, home to the "primitive white people," a movie that JJ Abrams also directed.  

![](/assets/images/starwars/planet-nibiru.jpg)  

<div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="height: 140px; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="https://www.space.com/21165-star-trek-nibiru-doomsday-planet.html" data-iframely-url="//iframely.net/cV1NlxD?card=small"></a></div></div>  


## C.) Limited Personal Experience
I have personal experience with regards to the topic that corroborates the evidence already laid out in this document. 

<!-- ### Point 1: Childhood
"Liking the Cornhuskers means you like Hitler," was something I learned at an early age from my neighbors. 

### Point 2: High School
The Blackshirts being a fascist group that has made a presence in Nebraska was the topic of discussion in my honors high school history class. Once it was brought out into the air that the Blackshirts of history have probably made a home for themselves in Nebraska, the racists quelled the discussion, saying that they were done talking so as to avoid having anything “happen” to the Blackshirts. 

### Point 3: Foreign Exchange
A foreign exchange student I met while I studied in the University said she chose UNL because she, “likes Adolf Hitler and the football team and all that.”

### Point 4: Colleague
I have a former colleague who moved to the area (Council Bluffs, because according to him there are fewer blacks) from turbulent Portland, Oregon out of a desire to be among the Blackshirts and because he wanted “to see what they’d get up to.”

### Point 5: Tattoos Tell the Tale
A friend of a former Neo-Nazi has told me that he knows of and individual with tattoos on his arms including a swastika, a Waffen SS symbol, the Cornhuskers and the Blackshirts all mixed together. 

### Point 6: Real Life Interviews
I have conducted dozens of real life interviews on the topic. The respondents understood better than internet respondents but were more likely to shut down the conversation due to awkwardness rather than to express feelings of approval or disapproval.  -->

## D.) Psychological War
Various techniques are used by this conspiracy, and are aimed at influencing the target audience's value system, belief system, emotions, motives, reasoning, and behavior. The methods used by the UNL Blackshirts are concealing in nature to who they are, while reinforcing attitudes and behaviors favorable to their objectives. Their methods destroy the morale of enemies through tactics that depress psychological states, while such tactics are uplifting to the co-conspirators hiding in plain sight.

Target audiences are governments, organizations, groups, and individuals, and it is not just limited to US citizens. Civilians of foreign territories are also the targets through technology and media which cause effects in the governments of their countries.

Everything explained in this document is a form of this type of political psychological warfare as it intimidates and is two-faced or multi-faced. 

### Equivocation
The large amount of evidence in this document clearly shows how real the Neo-Nazi conspiracy at UNL is, but co-conspirators will wrongly say that no single piece of evidence is convincing enough to warrant such claims, or they will equivocate in other ways. Don’t be fooled. There is clear and convincing evidence of a very real decades-long Neo-Nazi conspiracy at UNL.

### Pirate Flag Confusion
How the Blackshirts flags (all three of them) look like the basic pirate flag is often used to muddle a discussion. Don’t be confused. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/pirate-flag.jpg)

## E.) Recap
Before I conclude this document I want to quickly recap the points being made. There is a large number of connections that we can make between the University of Nebraska Blackshirts and Nazi Germany. Several of them, even the strong ones, appear to be coincidences or happenstance to the untrained reader. Others, like the use of the skull combined with the use of the term Blackshirts, are clearly not coincidences, and they shed light on the more coincidental evidence. 

A greater understanding is reached when we acknowledge that the desires of many millions of Germans are satisfied by this conspiracy being real. 

If you want it to be true it is true. 

If you want it to be just a conspiracy theory then its just a conspiracy theory. 

If you want to call me crazy for bringing it up then you can get away with that, too, at least at the time of this writing.  

And if you just want to say I'm wrong you can get away with that, too. 

But the truth is that if you want this conspiracy to be real in truth, then it is a real fascist nazi germany conspiracy. And for that reason, all of the people who have spoken on this claiming that it is only a theory, which is probably the common and popular thing to do, and the theory is right or wrong, or people who simply say that I'm wrong or crazy for talking about it, only these people who say these things are the people who are truly wrong. 

It is right to see the truth that this conspiracy is real or to remain indifferent. It is not right to attack people who believe this conspiracy. The equivocation that can be done, and how the conspiracy can seemingly turn on a dime, is all the more evidence of how menacing, dangerous and real this conspiracy is. 

Lets take a look at a little more evidence to bring the world together for you, then we'll get to the recap. The UNL Blackshirts/Cornhuskers have: 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/german-national.jpg)

### Nazis in Space
I'm sure the Neo-nazi fans of Iron Sky and other space nazi enthusiasts love this one. UNL have even put a bald skinhead in outer space. He showed off cornhusker gear the whole way. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/ne-astronaut.jpg)

### Facebook Group: Cornhusker Memes
There is a popular Nebraska facebook group called Cornhusker memes with nearly 100,000 followers. Memes about Nebraska are posted by the group. The group's banner image is a popular Nazi meme that has been altered to be a Cornhusker meme. Link

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/ne-memes-2.jpg)

### Warren Buffett
Warren Buffett is a well known fan of the Cornhuskers. Do you think he can hold the world in his hands as the wealthiest man in the world, but he’s oblivious of the facts shared in his document? I doubt it. Think twice about this man. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/ne-buffett.jpg)

### Blackshirts in the News
Evidence of the conspiracy can be found in the local news in Lincoln, but it just doesnt seem to make national headlines like you might think it should. Maybe the national news are all scared of Buffett buying their companies and firing them or ruining their careers for covering something like this. It's plausible. 

![](/assets/images/conspiracy/temple.jpg)

![](/assets/images/hate/blackshirts-graffiti.jpg)

From jewishjournal.com:

A pair of swastikas were found on a synagogue in Lincoln, Neb., on Jan. 15. 

The Omaha World-Herald reported that one swastika was painted on South Street Temple’s steps and the other was painted on the synagogue’s door. The words “black shirt” also were  painted on the door; black shirts were the uniforms that Italian dictator Benito Mussolini’s Fascist Party wore.

https://jewishjournal.com/news/united-states/309636/swastikas-found-on-nebraska-synagogue/

https://www.omaha.com/news/crime/swastikas-painted-on-lincoln-synagogue-police-investigating-incident-as-hate/article_d26e610c-4619-593d-8a5e-7301323c0c2b.html

The word "Blackshirts" spray was painted on a Synagogue along with a swastika. This is evidence that links the Cornhuskers/Blackshirts to the swastika in the hometown of the Cornhuskers. 

Compare and Contrast with the "Official Story"
The Huskers keep a page dedicated to the official story of why the defense is called the blackshirts. The story circulates in the news media now and then Unsurprisingly to me they did not include the poorly created story describing why the flag has a skull on it. Maybe they thought that this would be too many lies for one web page. The whole story is really a gem, likely a strong dose of pure bullshit, mixed with an ingenious duplicity and an ounce of truth. Put along side the news report of the spray-painted "blackshirts" on the Synagogue that we just talked about, this line really sparkles: 

 Say "Blackshirt" and the association is immediate: Nebraska defense.

Gee, I wonder why the local news reporters didn't think of that.

### Finally, the Recap

1. Same name as Hitler’s SS and allies: Blackshirts

2. Similar flag to Hitler’s SS and allies: Menacing, centered white skull on black background

3. Same color scheme as the Nazis: Red, White and Black with a touch of Gold

4. Similar location as Germany: Center of the continent

5. Similar demographics to Germany: Nebraska is mostly the German ethnic group

6. Similar political climate: Nebraska is right-wing

## F.) Relevant Laws
Seditious conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 2384) is a crime under United States law. It has been used against Neo-Nazis. Sports hooligans are known for causing civil unrest and taking part in territorialism and geo-politics in Europe. Therefore, considering that Nazis are from Europe, the UNL Blackshirts and sports fans could probably be said to be seditious, intent on causing territorial and geo-political unrest, and so this law could probably be used against the UNL Blackshirts. It is stated as follows:

>If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.[3]

Conspiracy against rights is a federal offense in the United States of America under 18 U.S.C. § 241. It has also been used against Neo-Nazis. It is stated as follows:

>If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person [...] in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same;...

>They shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such acts include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, they shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both, or may be sentenced to death.[4]

Legal status of crimes against humanity in international law:

>Unlike genocide and war crimes, which have been widely recognized and prohibited in international criminal law since the establishment of the Nuremberg principles, there has never been a comprehensive convention on crimes against humanity, even though such crimes are continuously perpetrated worldwide in numerous conflicts and crises. There are eleven international texts defining crimes against humanity, but they all differ slightly as to their definition of that crime and its legal elements.[5]

## G.) Conclusion
The recap shows clear and convincing evidence linking the UNL Blackshirts to allies of Adolf Hitler, to Adolf Hitler, to Neo-Nazisn and to fascism. Cornhusker fans look like German Nationals with Nazi tendencies, and you don't need this website to have figured that out. In addition German Nationals look like Cornhusker fans. The German national on the left can easily be mistaken for a Cornhusker fan. One who has looked into the depth of the connections, as they are made here or in other documents, can find clear and convincing evidence of a seditious conspiracy and a conspiracy against rights. This is a very serious issue that should be investigated by more state, federal and international authorities.
