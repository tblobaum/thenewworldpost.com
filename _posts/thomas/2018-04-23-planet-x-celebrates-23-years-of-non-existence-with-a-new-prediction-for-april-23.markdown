For almost a quarter century, humanity has been staring death in the face and bravely soldiering on unscathed. Or rather, a few of us have been looking for evidence of an existential threat in the form of a rogue planet named Nibiru or Planet X in grainy images and predicting when the end will arrive based on a few pixels or whatever else comes to mind.

This inane exercise in internet-based rumor-mongering has been going on for over two decades despite the lack of any credible evidence and now we have a new prediction that Nibiru will finally show up, vindicating its faithful believers, on April 23.

Yes, our old apocalyptic friend David Meade is in the headlines once again after giving us the entire winter off, which is thoughtful for a doomsayer, when you think about it.

Last we heard, the coming of Planet X in September (no, in October... or was it November?) was going to bring all kinds of havoc upon Earth by either colliding with our planet or coming near enough to trigger earthquakes and all other sorts of nastiness to precede the apocalypse.

After failing to appear and start the End Times no less than three times in 2017, we have a new date with fake destiny for 2018: British tabloids tell us Meade now believes Planet X or Nibiru will appear in the sky on April 23 before passing us in October and causing all kinds of crazy volcanic eruptions to kick off the Rapture.

These predictions are a combination of Biblical prophecy, numerology and psuedoscience that you can learn all about by going down the very weird Nibiru rabbit hole on YouTube anytime you want. Bottom line, as NASA, myself and others have repeated over and over again is that an unseen planet stalking around the inner solar system, waiting to crash or nearly crash into us is utter nonsense.

In the past I've taken each new silly prediction as an opportunity to talk about the need to examine such "evidence" critically or how confirmation bias can lead intelligent and reasonable people to believe such crazy claims.

And yet, here we are again. The message isn't getting through, I guess. So let's talk about another aspect of this: credibility.

At this point it has now been over 20 years since the notion of a Nibiru-based catastrophe was first put forth on a then fledgling internet in 1995.

The origin of this whole thing is thought to be a woman named Nancy Lieder who claims to have been given this special clairvoyant knowledge via a brain implant that allowed her to communicate with aliens from the Zeta Reticuli binary star system. Now, either this person has managed to accomplish multiple revolutionary breakthroughs in science and technology and go relatively unheralded for them, or she is, uh, imaginative. (You can judge for yourself at her current website.)

Lieder predicted a Nibiru encounter date in 2003 and then postponed it, but she's still on the look out.

Nibiru later received a good amount of mainstream attention in 2012 when it was thrown in with a bunch of end-of-the-Mayan-calendar End Times predictions, prompting a NASA scientist to debunk the notion in the video above.

When the great American solar eclipse of August 2017 captivated the nation, David Meade inserted his latest round of Nibiru predictions into the mix.

And now here we are in 2018, after at least half a dozen failed predictions of its appearance, Nibiru still does not exist. The very concept itself lacks credibility.

Somehow I think we will hear yet more about Nibiru well beyond 2018 and decades into the future because other predictions I've yet to even mention foresee the planet coming to get us all the way in 2085.

So sit back and enjoy practicing your critical thinking skills during this, the century of Nibiru.
