A Canadian soldier and two Afghan civilians were killed today when a suspected suicide bomber rammed a car into a convoy of Canadian troops in central Kandahar.

Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin confirmed the soldier's death and said three other Canadian soldiers were wounded in the attack in the southern Afghan city.

Officials in Afghanistan say another 10 civilians were also injured.

Taliban spokesman Qari Mohammad Yusuf claimed responsibility for the bombing in a telephone call to Reuters.

Canada has about 650 troops in Afghanistan, most of them in Kandahar, serving with the international stabilization force.
