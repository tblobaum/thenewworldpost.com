Neighbors who found two swastikas painted inside the Garner Township Cemetery Sunday morning were shocked to see the racist graffiti, but not surprised someone vandalized the cemetery.

Pottawattamie County Sheriff’s Department deputies are investigating the graffiti and vandalism.

The vandals knocked over headstones and left trash throughout the cemetery.

One neighbor called the act sick, and said he’s sick of cleaning up after the criminals.

“I just come up late at night and run them off,” said Rod Carlson, who lives in the area. “You can hear their stereos. They’re screaming and hollering, shooting fireworks. I know they’re here at 3 a.m.”

Carlson told KETV NewsWatch 7 he has called the sheriff many times to complain about the vandalism. but it continues happening.

Pottawattamie County Attorney Matt Wilber said that depending on the damage, the suspects, if caught, could face felonies. He said hate crimes are charged as assaults, not vandalism.

Anyone with information about the incident should call the Sheriff’s Department.
