HOLLYWOOD– Disenchantment is a popular animated series on Netflix. What makes the show as strong as it is are the well-told storylines that feature great character development along with funny jokes. 

The show is also known for having quite an assembly of voiceover talent that helps bring the compelling characters to life. Having capable voice actors is critical for the success of an animated series, and Disenchantment has plenty of them in key roles. 

One of the show’s funnier characters is known as Zog. Fans of the show many love the character without being quite able to place their voice. Let’s take a closer look at the talented voice actor who provides the voice of Zog on Disenchantment.

‘Disenchantment’ is about a rebel princess

Matt Groening is the creator of Disenchantment. Groening’s animated bona fides have long since been established before Disenchantment came to Netflix in 2018.

Before that, he created Futurama, the hit animated series airing on Fox and later Comedy Central after fans brought it back from cancellation. He also created a little series you might have heard of called The Simpsons. That show is still going strong after more than 30 years on the air, one of the longer runs for any show in TV history. 

Disenchantment has a similar animation style to those two shows, but that’s about all it has in common. According to IMDb, the fantasy story centers on a woman named Princess Tiabeanie, colloquially referred to as Bean. 

Bean is set up to marry another royal named Prince Merkimer, but she’s hardly happy about it. She wants nothing more than to be able to break free of the bonds of an arranged marriage to go off on her own, starting her own adventures. 

Bean comes into contact with a demon named Luci and an elf named Elfo, and her true adventure begins. The show has released three seasons’ worth of episodes, 30 in total. 

Who is Zog?

While Bean, Luci, and Elfo are plenty hilarious, it’s the show’s other supporting characters that help fill out its universe. One of those characters is known as King Zog. 

Zog is the king of Dreamland and father to Bean. He’s a harsh tyrant of a ruler. His parenting style is to yell excessively. What drives his character is the loss of his wife 15 years prior, as she was turned to stone. 

He loves her still despite the fact that she was simply using him to bear a child. Zog seems unable to connect with Bean, in large part due to having a general inability to relate to women because of his sadness over losing his wife.

An example of the character’s darkly comic persona came when he was buried alive, and taking solace in the fact that he would see his departed family members again. He quickly reversed his stance, however, when he realized he’d had most of them put to death. 

Who voices Zog? 

Disenchantment has Groening’s distinctive animation style, which makes it look like The Simpsons and Futurama. There are also several members of the Futurama cast who appear in this show as well. 

For example, the voice of Fry, Billy West, is also in this show’s cast. According to Screen Rant, Zog is voiced by a former member of the Futurama cast member as well: John DiMaggio. 

Fans of that show many remember DiMaggio as the gruff voice of the robot Bender on Futurama. But DiMaggio has had a long, illustrious career as a voice actor outside of the Groening animated universe. According to IMDb he’s also appeared in DuckTales, Rick and Morty, and played Batman villain the Joker among many other roles.
